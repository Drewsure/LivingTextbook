# Living Textbook Operating Notes

This document records repeatable procedures, environment constraints, and workarounds that future Codex sessions, engineers, or outside AI agents may need to recall.

These notes are not product standards. Product standards live in `docs/PRINCIPLES_AND_STANDARDS.md`. This file is the operational memory for how work actually gets done when tooling, branches, local permissions, or connectors behave in a consistent way.

## OW-001: GitHub Connector File Updates When Local Repo Access Is Blocked

Status: Active

Observed behavior: The local checkout may allow reading the repository root but block nested reads inside `LivingTextbook`, even after explicit read permission is requested. This prevents normal local patching and local build verification in that session.

Procedure:

1. Confirm the intended branch before editing. Current planning/build work has been on `legacy-source-import`.
2. Fetch target files through the GitHub connector using repository `Drewsure/LivingTextbook` and ref `legacy-source-import`.
3. Update or create files through the GitHub connector on the same branch.
4. Read back changed files through the connector after every meaningful update.
5. State clearly in the final response that local build/typecheck was not run if the local checkout remained inaccessible.
6. Do not assume the local checkout mirrors the remote working branch until it has been explicitly synchronized and verified.

Why this matters: It prevents accidental work on `main`, avoids destructive local workarounds, and preserves a reliable audit trail on the remote branch.

## OW-002: Branch Comparison May Fail Between `main` And `legacy-source-import`

Status: Active

Observed behavior: GitHub compare between `main` and `legacy-source-import` may report no common ancestor.

Procedure:

1. Do not use branch comparison as the only verification method.
2. Verify by reading back changed files directly from the target branch.
3. Mention this branch-state limitation when summarizing verification.
4. Avoid merge or reset operations until branch history is intentionally normalized.

## OW-003: Standards Must Be Updated When A Repeated Rule Appears

Status: Active

Procedure:

1. If a product/build principle affects future decisions, update `docs/PRINCIPLES_AND_STANDARDS.md`.
2. If a repeatable technical workaround or environment behavior appears, update this file.
3. If a major architecture decision is accepted, update `docs/DECISION_REGISTER.md` and add an ADR when useful.
4. Do not leave durable process knowledge only in chat history.
